# Purpose

As I was studying for AWS SAA-C03 using Adrian Cantrill's content, I decided to try to replicate the VPC that is being used in terraform instead of cloudformation as a way to apply my knowledge up to this point, reinforce concepts, and play around with terraform. This is mostly a tester script just to see if I could do it or not and in case I forget how to do some things in terraform
